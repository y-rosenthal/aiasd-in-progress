    "text": "1.2 Survey of Current AI Capabilities and Shortcomings\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, has featured very prominently in the news in recent years. Modern AI systems have been developed that can do many things that were once considered impossible for computers to do. The list below segments AI features into distinct categories. However, AI is constantly being incorporated into other systems at a rapid pace. Often an AI feature is just one part of a much larger system. Therefore, while the list below is demonstrative of AI abilities, keep in mind that these abilities are constantly being blended and incorporated into systems to the point that they might not be recognized as separate “AI” features. Some of the systems below are free to use, while others charge for their services. Specific offerings are in a constant state of flux with new services constantly appearing and existing services being modified all the time. The following list may very well be outdated by the time you read this. However, knowing that different types of AI systems exist gives you the ability to search for up to date offerings at your leisure.\nAn “AI model” is the underlying technology that powers the logic, reasoning and abilities of an AI. You can think of a “model” as similar to a “computer program”. Different AI “models” have different capabilities and power. Later, we will discuss some of the technical terminology that is associated with an “AI model”.\n\nChat systems - chatgpt is the most well known of these systems. However, there are many such systems available today. These are probably the most well known of all modern AI systems. These systems are able to carry on a running conversation. They can answer questions, give opinions, write novels, write software code, etc. We will study these types of systems in more depth later. Many of these systems have been given added features that allow them to search the web, generate images, view images and understand them, etc.\nExamples: https://chatgpt.com , https://claude.ai , https://grok.com , Google’s https://gemini.google.com , https://perplexity.ai/\nThese types of systems are powered by “Large Language Models” or LLMs. We will discuss more about the technology that is used to create an LLM a little later.\nImage generation - Generate images from text prompts. These systems can generate cartoons, photrealistic pictures, imitate styles of famous artists, etc. Some systems are more capable than others.\nExamples: https://chatgpt.com, https://www.midjourney.com/, etc.\nVideo generation - generate videos from text prompts.\nExamples: Google search for “ai video generator”\nHumanoid Robots - Robots in humanoid form. These robots can currently be used for repetitive tasks such as those that are commone in factories. Large investments are being made in the techonology. Many tecnologists and business professionals predict that humanoid robots will become adept enough in the relatively near future to be used for general tasks such as general household chores, e.g. cooking, vacuuming, etc. as well as more complex tasks following after that.\nExamples:\nBoston Dynamics Atlas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e1_QhJ1EhQ ,\nTesla bot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCNVet_wXGA\nAutonomous Systems - Use computer vision and reinforcement learning for self-driving - Tesla, Waymo. Automate delivery and logistics - drones, warehouse robots\nHealthcare\n\nPredict protein structures and assist in drug discovery - AlphaFold, Insilico\n\nAnalyze medical images and patient data for early detection - AI diagnostics systems\n\nFinance\n\nIdentify abnormal transaction patterns - fraud detection systems\n\nOptimize investment strategies automatically - algorithmic trading platforms\n\nProvide automated customer support - AI chatbots\n\nCreative Arts\n\nGenerate music from text prompts or melodies - Suno, Udio\n\nCreate and edit videos using generative AI - Runway, Pika\n\nEducation\n\nOffer personalized tutoring, feedback, and learning support - Khanmigo, Sora\n\nBusiness Productivity\n\nIntegrate AI into office tools for writing",

    "text": "1.3 A rough definition of AI\nThe definition of AI has changed over the years. For example getting a computer to play chess effectively was once considered a major AI milestone. However, in 1997, IBM’s chess playing system named “Deep Blue” beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. From roughly that point on, chess playing programs ceased to be viewed as AI and simply became viewed as just another computer program.\nArtificial intelligence has been notoriously difficult to define. One rough definition describes it as the science of creating machines that can perform tasks previously thought to require human intelligence. This is obviously a moving target as technology advances.",

    "section": "1.4 Modern AI (post 2005’ish)",
    "text": "1.4 Modern AI (post 2005’ish)\nIn the modern era (post 2005’ish) the creation of AI systems differs from classical computer programming in a very significant way. Modern AI systems are “trained” rather than “programmed”. The vast majority, if not all, of modern AI systems have an “Artificial Neural Network” (ANN) “model” at their core. The design of an ANN is loosely patterned after structures found in the human brain. The brain is composed of billions of neurons that are intricately interconnected to each other. Connections between different neurons have different strengths. When a person learns something, processes in the brain act to strengthen or weaken these connections.\nThe software that underlies modern ANNs is relatively simple. The software simulates the neurons and the connections between different neurons that are found in a brain. However, the real “smarts” of a modern AI system comes from the “training” that must be done to get the “strengths” (or weights) of the connections between these artificial neurons to the ideal levels in order for the ANN to accomplish a specific goal. In order to adjust the strengths of the connections between different neurons, the ANN is “shown” numerous examples of what it is being trained for.\nFor example, suppose an ANN is being trained to recognize whether a picture is a cat, a dog or something else. The ANN might be shown a picture and asked if it is a (1) a cat (2) a dog or (3) something else. If the AI responds correctly, nothing is changed in the ANN. However, if the AI responds incorrectly then the “weights”, or connection strengths between the artificial neurons in the ANN, are adjusted so that the ANN is “more likely” to get the right answer the next time for the given example. The exact technique for updating the weights are pretty technical and we won’t go into them now. The important thing to know is that the changing of weights between the neurons in response to incorrect actions by the ANN is in essence what gives the AI an ability to “learn” or be “trained”. (In fact, many advances in AI are directly related to improving the process by which these connections are strengthened or weakened.)\nThis is similar to what happens when humans study a subject and go through many different examples to test themselves. For example if a human is being trained to recognize different grades of diamonds, every example they see of a diamond helps to train their brain to pick up on the subtle differences between different grades. The human in this example slowly learns to pick up on the subtle patterns that distinguish one grade of diamond from another. Every time the human is shown something that they didn’t expect (e.g. they graded a diamond incorrectly and then were shown the correct grade) the connections between the neurons in the human brain are adjusted to help the human pick up on the subtle patterns that differentiate diamonds of different grades. In a similar way, by being shown lots of examples, an ANN is trained to pick up on the subtle patterns that help it to accomplish its task - in this case to pick up on the subtleties that distinguish a picutre of a cat from that of a dog from that of anything else. An ANN could be trained in a similar way to recognize different grades of diamonds. All such an AI would need to be trained in this way is sufficient examples of diamonds that have already been graded correctly.",

For example an AI system used by the IRS could be trained to identify tax returns that appear to be fraudulent. A chess playing AI could be trained to make optimal chess moves. A video game playing AI could be trained to move in the optimal way and make optimal decisions - e.g. what objects in the game should be attacked and which should not. Engineering all of these types of AI involve some sort of training that adjusts the weights between the neurons in the ANN model of the AI. These types of AIs however are often known as “narrow AI”, ie. they are intelligent at one particular task - e.g. identifying fraudulent tax returns or playing a specific game. However, these types of AIs are not designed to tackle problems outside of the domain that they’ve been specifically trained to do.",

    "text": "1.8 Large Language Models (LLMs) vs other types of models\nChat based models such as ChatGPT have achieved amazing results and often give the appearance of being truly intelligent. They seem to know about everything and seem to have “general knowledge”. However as we will see these models are technically not AGI - they are trained to do one very specific thing … given a portion of text, predict the word that will come next. More specifically these LLMs are trained to generate a probability distribution for the next word to appear after a given sequence of words.\nFor example, suppose I told you that someone just said:\n“Joe went to the ______ …” and I asked you to assign probabilities of the next word being (a) store (b) circus (c) intelligent. It’s reasonable to say that “store” would have the highest probability as it’s very common for people to go to a store, “circus” would have a somewhat lower probabability as it’s not as common for people to go to a circus and “intelligent” would have a very low probability, as it’s not quite clear what could be meant by “Joe went to the intelligent …”.\nHowever, suppose I told you that someone just said\nThe training data for these chat systems include vast amounts of printed text. It’s often said that these systems are trained on the entire Internet. While that might not be exactly accurate, it is a good way to conceptualize the real story. In actuality modern commercial LLMs are trained on massive, diverse text datasets that include:\n\nPublic web content – websites, articles, forums, and open data sources.\nBooks and academic texts – digitized literature and research papers.\nCode repositories – for models that handle programming (e.g., GitHub data).\nLicensed or proprietary datasets – curated high-quality text obtained legally.\nHuman feedback data – conversations or task examples used for fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n\nThese datasets can total trillions of words. Training involves adjusting billions of model parameters to predict the next word in a sequence — learning language, style, and reasoning patterns from the data. Several common large-scale datasets are used (or adapted) for training or pretraining LLMs. Examples include:\n\nThe Pile – 825 GB of diverse text (academic papers, books, web content, code).\nCommon Crawl – a regularly updated scrape of the public web, used by most major models.\nC4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus) – a cleaned, English-focused subset of Common Crawl.\nWikipedia – high-quality encyclopedic text for factual grounding.\nBooks datasets – e.g., Books1/Books2 (used internally by OpenAI and others).\nGithub/code datasets – for code-capable models like Codex or Gemini Code.\n\nCommercial labs often combine public, licensed, and proprietary corpora, cleaning and filtering them heavily to remove low-quality, duplicate, or unsafe content.",

This is generally known as “supervised learning”. Another popular method of training an AI involves the AI learning from trial and error using a method known as “reinforcement learning”.\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\nIn simple terms:\n\nThe agent takes an action in a situation.\nThe environment responds with a new situation and a reward (positive or negative).\nOver time, the agent learns a policy — a strategy for choosing actions that maximize total reward.\n\nIt’s modeled on behavioral psychology: trial, error, and feedback. For example, a robot might learn to walk by trying movements, falling (negative reward), and staying upright longer (positive reward).\nMathematically, RL often uses methods like Q-learning or policy gradients to estimate which actions lead to the best long-term outcomes.\nIn short, RL is about learning from consequences, not from explicit instruction or labeled examples.",

Non-technical users interact with computers by using the mouse to click and drag items on the screen. These users are using the “Graphical User Interface” (GUI) of the computer (see below for more info). Most people are not even aware that there is a way to do just about everything on a computer without even touching a mouse.\nTechnical users (e.g. programmers, computer system administrators, etc) often use a totally different mechanism to interact with the computer. They use a special program (known as a CLI or “command line interpreter”) to type special “commands” to do different things on the computer. For example, a technically inclined user, might type the command mkdir progressReports to create a new folder named progressReports. By contrast, non-technical users might right-click in the FileExplorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) programs and choose “new file” from the menu that is displayed.\nThere many, many (hundreds?) of different commands that can be typed in the CLI program. Each command is used to accomplish something specific on the computer. Using a CLI is a skill, similar to programming, that takes some time to master. It is obviously much easier for a typical computer user to use the GUI on the computer. Most people aren’t even aware there is another way. Why then would technical users use a Comamnd Line Interface at all?\nIt takes time and practice to master how to control a computer by using a CLI (command line interface). However, for technical users, the time spent learning how to use a CLI is time well spent. For the following reasons:",

    "text": "Many tools that are used in software development only have a CLI commands with no equivalent GUI program.\nOnce you have learned and mastered the numerous CLI commands, it can become trivial to accomplish very sophisticated results with much less effort than would be required if only using a GUI. A technical user might type the command mv project1/*2025* project2 to move all files with 2025 in their name from the project1 folder to the project2 folder. If there are 100 files in the project1 folder and 50 of those files have 2025 somewhere in their name, a typical non-technical user might take several minutes or longer to find each of the desired files and drag them to the correct folder. By contrast, typing the above command in the CLI and pressing ENTER takes a few seconds. This is a simple example. The general rule though is that for people who have mastered the CLI commands are able to control the computer in a much quicker and more efficient way.\nIt is relatively easy to “automate” the CLI commands. You can collect numerous CLI commands in a single file, known as a “script file”. Then you can direct the CLI to run all of the commands that are saved in the script file at once. This opens the door to writing script files that can be reused at different times or on different computers to accomplish a repetitive task.",

    "text": "4.4 What is a CLI and Why Should You Care?\nA CLI (Command Line Interface) is a way to interact with your computer using text commands instead of clicking on icons and buttons. Think of it like texting your computer instructions instead of pointing at things.\nWhen people talk about “the command line” or “the terminal,” they’re usually referring to a CLI. It might look intimidating at first—just a black or white screen with text—but once you learn a few commands, it becomes a powerful way to work with files and folders on your computer.\n\n4.4.1 What is Bash?\nBash (which stands for “Bourne Again Shell”) is one of the most popular CLIs. It’s the standard on most Linux systems and Mac computers. When you type commands in Bash, you’re essentially having a conversation with your computer in a special language it understands.\n\n\n4.4.2 How to Access Bash on Different Systems\nOn Mac: Open the Terminal application. You can find it by pressing Cmd + Space and typing “Terminal”, or by going to Applications → Utilities → Terminal.\nOn Windows: Windows doesn’t come with Bash by default. You have a few options:\n\nGit Bash - A lightweight option that comes with Git. It’s perfect for basic Bash commands and is what we recommend for getting started.\nWSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - A full Linux environment inside Windows. This is more advanced and beyond the scope of this guide.\n\nImportant Note for Windows Users: Windows has its own native CLIs called CMD (Command Prompt) and PowerShell. These are conceptually similar to Bash—they let you type commands to control your computer—but the actual commands are different. For example, in Bash you use ls to list files, but in PowerShell you use Get-ChildItem or dir. This guide focuses on Bash commands.",

The ls command lists the files and folders in your current directory.\n$ ls\nOutput:\nREADME.txt  documents  music  pictures  projects\nGreat! We can see there’s a README.txt file and four folders: documents, music, pictures, and projects.\n\n4.10.1 Command Options: Making ls More Useful\nMost Bash commands have options (also called “flags”) that modify their behavior. Options usually start with a dash -.\nLet’s try ls with the -l option, which shows the “long” format with more details:\n$ ls -l\nOutput:\ntotal 4\n-rw-r--r-- 1 username username    0 Oct 22 12:00 README.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 documents\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 music\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 pictures\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 projects\nNow we see much more information! The first column shows permissions, the numbers are file sizes in bytes, and we see dates and times. Lines starting with d are directories (folders), while lines starting with - are regular files.\nLet’s add the -t option, which sorts by time (newest first):\n$ ls -l -t\nOutput:\ntotal 4\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 projects\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 pictures\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 music\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 documents\n-rw-r--r-- 1 username username    0 Oct 22 12:00 README.txt\nNow add -r to reverse the sort order (oldest first):\n$ ls -l -t -r\nOutput:\ntotal 4\n-rw-r--r-- 1 username username    0 Oct 22 12:00 README.txt\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 documents\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 music\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 pictures\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 username username 4096 Oct 22 12:00 projects\n\n\n4.10.2 Options Can Be Combined and Reordered!\nHere’s something cool: the order of options doesn’t matter. These all do the same thing:\n$ ls -l -t -r\n$ ls -r -t -l\n$ ls -t -r -l\nEven better, you can combine single-letter options into one:\n$ ls -ltr\nThis is exactly the same as ls -l -t -r! It’s just shorter to type. So -ltr means “long format, sorted by time, reversed order.”",

You can navigate with arrow keys and press q to quit.\nNote: Some lightweight Bash environments (like Git Bash on Windows) might not have man pages installed. If man doesn’t work, you can search online for “bash ls man page” or “man ls” and find the documentation online.",

The syntax is: cp source destination\nLet’s copy our test file:\n$ cp test.txt test-copy.txt\n$ ls\nOutput:\nREADME.txt  documents  music  pictures  projects  temp  test-copy.txt  test.txt\nNow we have both the original test.txt and a copy called test-copy.txt.\nTo copy a file into a folder:\n$ cp test.txt documents/\n$ ls documents/\nOutput:\nnotes  reports  test.txt\nThe test.txt file has been copied into the documents folder!\nTo copy an entire folder (directory) and all its contents, use the -r option (which stands for “recursive”):\n$ cp -r documents documents-backup\n$ ls\nOutput:\nREADME.txt  documents  documents-backup  music  pictures  projects  temp  test-copy.txt  test.txt\n\n\n4.14.3 Moving and Renaming: The mv Command\nThe mv command moves files or folders to a new location. It’s also used to rename things!\nTo rename a file:\n$ mv test-copy.txt renamed-file.txt\n$ ls\nOutput:\nREADME.txt  documents  documents-backup  music  pictures  projects  renamed-file.txt  temp  test.txt\nThe file test-copy.txt has been renamed to renamed-file.txt.\nTo move a file into a folder:\n$ mv renamed-file.txt temp/\n$ ls temp/\nOutput:\nrenamed-file.txt\nThe file has moved into the temp folder. Notice it’s no longer in our current directory.\nYou can move and rename at the same time:\n$ mv test.txt documents/my-test-file.txt\n$ ls documents/\nOutput:\nmy-test-file.txt  notes  reports  test.txt\n\n\n4.14.4 Removing Files: The rm Command\nThe rm command removes (deletes) files. Be careful! There’s no “undo” or trash bin—deleted files are gone forever!\n$ rm documents/my-test-file.txt\n$ ls documents/\nOutput:\nnotes  reports  test.txt\nTo remove multiple files at once:\n$ cd temp/\n$ touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n$ ls\nOutput:\nfile1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  renamed-file.txt\n$ rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n$ ls\nOutput:\nrenamed-file.txt\nTo remove a folder and everything inside it, use -r (recursive) and usually -f (force, to avoid confirmation prompts):\n$ cd ..\n$ rm -rf documents-backup\n$ ls\nOutput:\nREADME.txt  documents  music  pictures  projects  temp\nWarning: rm -rf is very powerful and very dangerous! Always double-check what you’re deleting. There’s a famous joke: “To understand what rm -rf / does, try it!” Don’t actually try it—it would attempt to delete everything on your computer!\n\n\n4.14.5 Removing Empty Folders: The rmdir Command\nThe rmdir command removes directories, but only if they’re empty:\n$ cd temp/\n$ rm renamed-file.txt\n$ cd ..\n$ rmdir temp\n$ ls\nOutput:\nREADME.txt  documents  music  pictures  projects\nIf you try to use rmdir on a folder that has files in it, you’ll get an error:\n$ rmdir documents\nOutput:\nrmdir: failed to remove 'documents': Directory not empty\nFor non-empty folders, use rm -rf instead.",

    "text": "4.15 Reading Files: cat, less, and more\n\n4.15.1 The cat Command\nThe cat command displays the contents of a file. It’s short for “concatenate,” but most people use it to quickly view file contents:\n$ cd documents/notes/\n$ cat ideas.txt\nOutput:\n(displays the contents of ideas.txt)\nIf the file is empty (like ours), you won’t see anything! Let’s add some content first using a different method:\n$ echo \"My brilliant idea: automated coffee maker\" &gt; ideas.txt\n$ cat ideas.txt\nOutput:\nMy brilliant idea: automated coffee maker\nYou can also use cat to view multiple files:\n$ echo \"More ideas here!\" &gt; ideas2.txt\n$ cat ideas.txt ideas2.txt\nOutput:\nMy brilliant idea: automated coffee maker\nMore ideas here!\nLimitation of cat: If the file is very long, cat dumps everything to the screen at once, and you’ll need to scroll back up to see the beginning. For long files, use less or more.\n\n\n4.15.2 The less Command\nThe less command shows file contents one page at a time, letting you scroll through:\n$ less ideas.txt\nWhen using less: - Arrow keys or spacebar to scroll down - b to scroll back up - / followed by text to search - q to quit\nless is great for long files because you have full control over navigation.\n\n\n4.15.3 The more Command\nThe more command is similar to less but older and simpler:\n$ more ideas.txt\nWith more: - Spacebar to go to the next page - Enter to go down one line - q to quit\nDifference between less and more: - less lets you scroll backward; more only goes forward - less has more features (searching, better navigation) - The joke: “less is more, and more is less!” (meaning less is actually more capable than more)\nIn practice, most people use less because it’s more flexible. But both do the job for viewing files!",

This saves time and prevents typos.\nUse the up arrow to cycle through previous commands. This is super handy when you need to run the same command again.\nGoogle is your friend: When you’re stuck, search for “bash how to [what you want to do]” and you’ll find lots of help.",

It’s like having a time machine for your code and files.\nGit is the most popular version control system in the world. It keeps track of every change you make to your files, who made each change, and when.

Edit files in your working directory 2. Add changes to the staging area (choosing what to save) 3. Commit the staged changes to the repository (creating a save point)\nThink of it like taking a group photo: 1. Everyone gets ready (working directory) 2. You choose who will be in the photo (staging area) 3. You take the picture (commit)",

    "text": "5.15 Working with Remote Repositories\nSo far, everything we’ve done is on your local computer. Now let’s learn how to work with remote repositories (like on GitHub).\n\n5.15.1 Cloning a Repository: git clone\nWhen you want to download someone else’s project (or your own from GitHub), you use git clone:\n$ git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git\nOutput:\nCloning into 'repository-name'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 50, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (50/50), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (35/35), done.\nremote: Total 50 (delta 10), reused 45 (delta 8), pack-reused 0\nReceiving objects: 100% (50/50), 12.34 KiB | 1.23 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (10/10), done.\nThis creates a new folder with the entire project and all its Git history!\nNote: You don’t need to run git init after cloning—the repository is already set up.\n\n\n5.15.2 Checking Remote Connections: git remote\nTo see which remote repositories your project is connected to:\n$ git remote\nOutput:\n(no output if you used git init)\nIf you had cloned from GitHub, you’d see:\norigin\n“Origin” is the conventional name for the main remote repository.\nTo see more details:\n$ git remote -v\nOutput:\n(no output if no remotes are configured)\nWith a remote configured, you’d see:\norigin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (push)\n\n\n5.15.3 Adding a Remote: git remote add\nIf you started with git init (not git clone) and want to connect to GitHub later, you can add a remote:\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git\nOutput:\n(no output - success!)\nNow verify:\n$ git remote -v\nOutput:\norigin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (push)\n\n\n5.15.4 Sending Changes to Remote: git push\nAfter making commits locally, you send them to GitHub with git push:\n$ git push origin main\nThis means “push my commits to the ‘origin’ remote, on the ‘main’ branch.”\nOutput:\nEnumerating objects: 12, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (12/12), done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (9/9), 1.23 KiB | 1.23 MiB/s, done.\nTotal 9 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nTo https://github.com/username/repository-name.git\n   a1b2c3d..c3d4e5f  main -&gt; main\nYour changes are now on GitHub for the world to see!\nFirst-time push: The very first time you push, you might need:\n$ git push -u origin main\nThe -u sets up tracking so future pushes can just be git push without specifying origin main.\n\n\n5.15.5 Getting Changes from Remote: git pull\nIf others made changes on GitHub (or you made changes from another computer), you can download them with git pull:\n$ git pull origin main\nOutput:\nremote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nremote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nUnpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 654 bytes | 654.00 KiB/s, done.\nFrom https://github.com/username/repository-name\n   c3d4e5f..d4e5f6g  main       -&gt; origin/main\nUpdating c3d4e5f..d4e5f6g\nFast-forward\n README.md | 2 ++\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\nThis downloads new commits and merges them into your local repository.\nPro tip: Always git pull before starting work to make sure you have the latest changes!",

A text cannot contain any pictures, charts, colors, etc.\nBinary files may contain any of the above types of content.\n\nThere are two types of programs for typing text.\n\ntext editors - these are only able to create text files. They don’t have the ability to create pictures, colors, charts, etc.\nword processors - these are programs such as Microsoft Word, Pages (on Mac), Excel, or any program that can create anything other than just plain text\n\nComputer programs for just about all programming languages must be stored in text files and must be written using a text editor program.\nComputer programs should NOT be written with a word processor. This is because even if a word processor program is used to create a file that just contains text (and no pictures) the file is still stored in a binary file.\nTherefore when creating or editing any code files in your project make sure to use a text editor (not a word processor). The following come installed be default\n\nNotead (windows)\nTextEdit (mac) - Unfortunately TextEdit will not work as a “true” text editor unless you setup “plain text mode” in TextEdit. See below for how to do so:\n\n\n6.4.1 How to put TextEdit (on mac) in plain text mode:\n\nFor a document that’s already open:\nGo to the Format menu at the top of your screen Click Make Plain Text (or press Shift+Cmd+T)\n\n\nTo make plain text the default for new documents:\n\nOpen TextEdit\nGo to TextEdit menu &gt; Preferences (or press Cmd+,)\nIn the New Document tab, select Plain text instead of “Rich text”\nWhile you’re there, you might also want to uncheck “Smart quotes” and “Smart dashes” in the Options section, as these can cause issues with code\n\nOnce you do this, all new TextEdit documents will open in plain text mode by default, which is much better for writing code since it won’t add any hidden formatting characters. You’ll notice the difference immediately - in plain text mode, you won’t see font formatting options in the toolbar, and your text will appear in a monospace font (usually Monaco or Menlo), which is ideal for code.",

Technologies used to implement websites range from simple websites that use just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to very complex websites that incorporate many other technologies. However, almost every website has a collection of the following 3 types of files\n\nHTML files (usually end with .html)\nThese files contain the text of what is displayed on the website. Note that more complex websites often use techniques that generate a lof of the text for the website with other techniques.\nCSS files (usually end with .css)\nThese files contain the instructions for the “styling” of the website - such as colors and fonts for different sections of the website.\nJavaScript files (usually end with .js)\nThese files contain code that can make a website more interactive and reactive to user input.\n\nWe will create our first code file, index.html below. To create the file we can use one of the following two techniques:\n\n6.5.1 Using a text editor to create our first code file\nWe want to create a file named index.html that contains the HTML code shown below. To do so you can create the file in a text editor such as Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit ( in “plain text” mode - see above) on Mac. Make sure to save the file in the folder that you created above.

In this case, the name of the file is index.html.\nThe command ends with a line simply says EOF (no spaces before or after). The letters EOF stand for “End Of File”. Note that you can replace EOF on the first and last lines with any unique set of\nThe contents of the file you want to create is placed between the first line (i.e. cat ...) and the last line (i.e. EOF).\n\nThis technique can be used to create any text file you like.\ncat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; index.html\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Hello Site&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Git!&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This is my first version.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nEOF\nThis technique is usefol for creating new files but is not useful when you want to edit an existing file. To do that the simplest thing to do is to use a text eidtor and described above.",

The computer code that is sent back to the browser is a combination of the following three different computer languages:\n\nHTML\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets)\nJavaScript\n\nAt the very basic level the following are the roles of each of these languages.\n\nHTML contains the actual words that will appear on the webpage and how they are structured - e.g. what text is a header, what text should be arranged in lists or in tables, etc.\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - is a language that contains instructions that describe the “look and feel” of the page - e.g. what colors, fonts, etc should be used.\nJavaScript is a language that describes actions that should happen on the page - e.g. popup windows that appear when a user clicks on something, buttons changing color when a user hovers his mouse over the button, etc.\n\nIn reality, the above list does not capture the whole picture. For example JavaScript can do a LOT of things - including changing the text that appears on the page (which is normally the job of HTML).

    "text": "Every web server computer on the Internet has a distinct “name”. When the browser sends a message to the web server program it does so by specifying it’s name. You can think of the “domain name” of a website (e.g. google.com, amazon.com, etc) as the “name” of the web server computer that is running the website.\n\nREMEMBER that we said that even though large websites such as google are actually running on multiple computers - however, we can conceptually understand how everything works by imagining that they actually run on just a single computer.\n\nThe domain name in a URL simply identifies which computer on the Internet, the browser need to contact to get the desired webpage. For example, the follwing URL goes to a page on amazon’s website for toys: https://www.amazon.com/toys/b?ie=UTF8&node=165793011 This URL has a lot in it. The part that says www.amazon.com is the “name” of the computer that runs amazon’s website. The rest of the URL has other significance that we will not discuss now (maybe later …)\n\n8.0.1 IP addresses\nIn reality the “domain name” of the computer is converted into the computer version of a telephone number - called an IP address. An IP address looks like a few numbers separated by periods (see below). The browser actually looks up the IP address for the domain name and uses that to contact the web server computer. (For now let’s ignore “how” the browser looks up the IP address for a particular domain name - just know that it does and uses the IP address to “call up” the server computer).\nYou can see the ip address for www.amazon.com by using the ping program on your Bash “command line”. The ping program sends a message to the computer asking it to respond. The computer simply responds with a very short message to indicate that it is “alive” and not “down”. The ping program simply reports that the computer responded. The ping program also reports the IP address of the computer that responded.\nSimply type the following command\nping www.amazon.com\nThe response will look similar to this (your response might look a little different). On some computers the output stops after a few lines of this. On other computers you can press ctrl-c to stop the output if it keeps going.\nPING d3ag4hukkh62yn.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from server-54-192-52-164.ord53.r.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164): icmp_seq=1 ttl=245 time=307 ms\n64 bytes from server-54-192-52-164.ord53.r.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164): icmp_seq=2 ttl=245 time=20.1 ms\n64 bytes from server-54-192-52-164.ord53.r.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164): icmp_seq=3 ttl=245 time=14.7 ms\n64 bytes from server-54-192-52-164.ord53.r.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164): icmp_seq=4 ttl=245 time=15.8 ms\n64 bytes from server-54-192-52-164.ord53.r.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164): icmp_seq=5 ttl=245 time=13.6 ms\n64 bytes from server-54-192-52-164.ord53.r.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164): icmp_seq=6 ttl=245 time=21.6 ms\n64 bytes from server-54-192-52-164.ord53.r.cloudfront.net (54.192.52.164): icmp_seq=7 ttl=245 time=12.2 ms\n... etc\nThe response above, simply means that the server computer is up and running and responding.

They would then place the files that contain the code on the server computer. The server would then send those files to the browser and the browser would display the files.\nYou could theoretically create a website by just writing code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, modern websites have become very complicated to create. A “framework” is a language/software-program that makes it easier for software developer to create programs or websites. The framework usually introduces another language that the software developer uses to create the website. The framework language in turn generates the detailed HTML, CSS, Javascript that is actually used by the browser.\nThere are many different “client side frameworks” that work in this way.

    "text": "9.2 “meta” frameworks\nCoding websites keeps growing in complexity. The frameworks were initially intended to make it easier in that web developers would not have to code the HTML, CSS and Javascript themselves. The more compact framework languages would generate the HTML, CSS and Javascript.\nToday “meta” frameworks have been introduced to the web development world. These “meta frameworks” introduce yet new programming language rules and constructs which again make it more concise to write the code for a website.\nThese “meta frameworks” are similar to frameworks in that the code written for the meta frameworks generate the code for the underlying framework. In turn the generated framework code automatically generates the underlying HTML, CSS and Javascript that is sent to the browser.\nFor example:\n\nNextJS is a “meta framework” that is built on top of the “React” framework.\nNuxtJS (with a “u”) is a “meta framework” that is built on top of the “VueJS” framework.\n\nThey combine client-side rendering (CSR) with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), so they’re considered full-stack or hybrid frameworks.",

It ensures that data exchange is structured, secure, and efficient.\nServer Role:\nThe MCP server hosts and manages endpoints that the AI model can query. It might connect to databases, APIs, or custom business systems to provide live context.\nClient Role:\nThe AI model (or the system running it) acts as the client, sending requests to the MCP server to fetch or modify information.\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Example Use Case\nFor instance, an MCP server might: - Provide access to a company’s internal documentation. - Retrieve current metrics from a database. - Execute small automation tasks on behalf of the AI.\n\n\n10.1.3 Summary\nIn short, an MCP server bridges the gap between an AI model and external data or functionality, enabling more intelligent, context-aware responses and actions.",

Then take a screenshot of the webpage.\nYou may call the following tools:\n\nbrowser_navigate(url)\nbrowser_click(element, ref)\nbrowser_type(element, ref, text)\n\nUse them when appropriate.\n\nThe agent then uses the “playwright” server tools to carry out those steps. You may need to press “OK” (or similar) to allow the agent to carry out each of the steps.

It’s going to be a task management application. First, you’ll have to log in.\n\n\n0:27\nAnd then on the dashboard, you can see all the tasks you’ve\n\n\n0:32\ncreated. And you can click here to create a new task. It also has a special AI feature to assign a label\n\n\n0:40\nautomatically, depending on the task description. Once you’ve created a task, you can also click to go in\n\n\n0:48\nand edit it. You can change the label, change any of the fields, and you can also upload an image to it.\n\n\n0:57\nThe app also has authentication, so when you log in, you can only see your own task. And you can go to your profile\n\n\n1:04\nand you can see how many tasks you’ve created. There’s also a monthly subscription that you\n\n\n1:09\ncan use to upgrade your account. And the payments are implemented with Stripe, so if a user\n\n\n1:15\nis signed up, they can click on this page to update or to cancel their subscription. As you can see, it’s quite a simple project, but it\n\n\n1:23\nuses all the fundamental building blocks that nearly every single SaaS application will need to have.\n\n\n1:29\nThings like authentication, compute, and data storage. We will need to use a tech stack that will let us do all of those things.\n\n\n1:36\nThere’s actually quite a few viable options here. I ended up going with NextJS and Supabase. I like the feature\n\n\n1:42\nset that it offers, and I think that it strikes a good balance between simplicity and capability.\n\n\n1:49\nThe GitHub link for this entire project will be available in the video description. You can go there\n\n\n1:54\nto browse the code or to clone the entire project. Now, this video isn’t exactly a coding tutorial, because each\n\n\n2:00\nof the features here could probably be its own video. Instead, I’m going to focus on helping you understand\n\n\n2:06\nhow all of the pieces fit together, and I’m going to show you how to set up this project on your own machine, so that you can\n\n\n2:13\nstart building things with it right away. By the end of this video, you’ll have a good understanding\n\n\n2:19\nof how Supabase works, you’ll learn four of its core features, and you’ll also have the\n\n\n2:25\nactual project up and running on your machine. I’ve prepared this video assuming that you’re at\n\n\n2:31\nleast a mid-level developer, and here are some of the technologies we’ll be working with. If you aren’t familiar with them, then I’ll still\n\n\n2:38\ntry to make it as accessible as I can, but it just might be a little bit hard to follow. First, let’s start with a high-level overview of the whole project.\n\n\n2:46\nThese are the features that we want our app to have. They include task management, image attachments, automatic\n\n\n2:53\nAI labeling for our tasks, and the ability to sell premium subscription plans to our users.\n\n\n2:59\nIt’s a pretty standard set of features for an app, but the reason I chose these is that behind\n\n\n3:04\neach of these features, there’s a really important concept that I want to show you. So, having them all in one project is a great way\n\n\n3:12\nto learn how to apply all of them at once. Now, let’s take a quick look at the architecture\n\n\n3:18\nfor this project. Here is a simplified diagram. For the backend, we’ll be using Supabase. Supabase describes itself as an open-source Firebase alternative,\n\n\n3:27\nand if you don’t know what that is, you can sort of think of it as a lightweight cloud platform.\n\n\n3:33\nIt gives us almost everything we need for this app right out of the box and in one place. The database is going to be a PostgreSQL database,\n\n\n3:41\nand the storage system is pretty similar to something like Amazon S3 or Firestore.\n\n\n3:47\nFor our backend compute, we can also create edge functions using TypeScript. And there’s also an inbuilt authentication system that\n\n\n3:54\nintegrates really well with all of these features, but also with third-party providers like Google, OAuth.\n\n\n4:00\nThe front end is going to be a fully static NextJS app. You’ll have a client library that will talk to Supabase directly.\n\n\n4:07\nOn top of that, we will also need a couple of third-party services to round out our feature set.\n\n\n4:13\nWe will need a Google Cloud account if we want users to be able to sign in with Google. For our backend feature, we can actually use any LLM here.\n\n\n4:21\nAnd I’m just going to use OpenAI. And finally, we’ll use Stripe for our payments system. Now, how does this all get hosted, and how much will it cost?\n\n\n4:30\nWell, you basically have a few different options with Supabase. The easiest option is to use their cloud service.\n\n\n4:37\nThis is really simple to set up, and it’s probably the best option if you want to get started as soon as possible. It comes with a free tier, which works perfectly fine for this project.\n\n\n4:46\nAnd in fact, that is what we’ll be using. The next tier up is $25 a month, and it gives you a lot more of everything.\n\n\n4:53\nThat being said, Supabase is also completely open source. So another option is that you can host it yourself\n\n\n5:00\nor deploy it to a cloud provider like AWS or GCP. But I think that’s going to be quite complex to manage,\n\n\n5:06\nand I don’t really recommend doing that. It’s just good to know that it is an option. Okay, so now that we’ve gone over all the high-level stuff, let’s\n\n\n5:14\nlook at our plan for how we’re going to set up the project. We will need to set up five separate things to get this all working.\n\n\n5:20\nWe’ll start by just downloading the code from GitHub and then creating a project on the Supabase cloud.\n\n\n5:26\nThen we’ll go and set up the rest of the dependencies first. Google OAuth, OpenAI, and Stripe.\n\n\n5:32\nAnd then we’ll have all the API keys we need to go back to our project and actually finish setting it up.\n\n\n5:38\nHere’s a checklist of the steps that we are going to take. And throughout this video, we’ll go down the\n\n\n5:43\nlist and we’ll tick them off one by one. Let’s start off by cloning the project. By the way, all the links you need for this video\n\n\n5:49\nare going to be in the video description. Once you’ve cloned the project, open the project in your terminal and run npm install.\n\n\n5:56\nThis should finish successfully, but there might be a few\n\n\n6:01\nwarnings because things are always getting deprecated. We will also need to create two local .env\n\n\n6:09\nfiles to store our environment variables. I’ve actually created an example.env file for you here.\n\n\n6:16\nSo if you’re on a Unix system, you can just run this command to create copies from that. And if you open the project in VSCode, you’ll be able to see them here.\n\n\n6:29\nSo here is the example file, and here are the two files I’ve just created. And they have to be named exactly this way because that’s\n\n\n6:37\nwhere our project is going to be looking for them. Now here are some of the environment variables that we’ll need to fill in.\n\n\n6:43\nWe’ll come back to this later once we actually have them. That’s all the setup we have to do for our project code at the moment.\n\n\n6:50\nBut if you try to run it now, it won’t work because we haven’t set up any of the backend yet. But if you do want to see the front end of the project\n\n\n6:58\non its own and play around with it, then I actually have an earlier commit where it’s just\n\n\n7:04\nusing placeholders for all of the backend logic. So if you go to the GitHub repo and click on the commits\n\n\n7:10\ntab, you can scroll down all the way to the bottom. And there’s this commit here that says front end boilerplate.\n\n\n7:18\nSo you can copy this commit hash, and then you can run this command in your project folder to check out that specific commit.\n\n\n7:27\nSo if you use that command to roll it back to that commit, you should be able to run npm run dev,\n\n\n7:33\nand it’ll start a local version of the site. And this will run a version of the site where you just have the\n\n\n7:39\nfront end and all of the backend integration is stripped out. You can still click around and play around with the UI, but it won’t do anything.\n\n\n7:47\nAnd you’ll find that any of the buttons or the interactions will basically just console log a to-do statement for it to be implemented.\n\n\n7:54\nBut now, back to this project, we will want to use the latest commit. So if you did check out the older commit, then\n\n\n8:00\nplease use this command to revert it back. Let’s move on to the next step, which is to create an actual Supabase project.\n\n\n8:06\nGo to Supabase.com and create or log in with your account. In your dashboard, click create new project.\n\n\n8:15\nYou might also have to create an organization first, but I already have one here.\n\n\n8:21\nFill in your project name and generate a secure password for your database. You’ll also want to copy the database password\n\n\n8:28\nas well, because you’re going to need it later when we set up the Supabase CLI.\n\n\n8:34\nAnd finally, choose a region that’s close to you or your customers. Then go ahead and create the project.\n\n\n8:42\nThis will take a few minutes to set up, but while you wait, it does show you your API keys and some important\n\n\n8:48\ninformation that we will need in the next step. Or if your project already finished setting\n\n\n8:53\nup, then it will look something like this. On the toolbar on the left, go over to project settings.\n\n\n9:00\nYou’ll find some really useful things on this page. For example, you can look at what compute your project is configured to use.\n\n\n9:07\nYou can also check out how much storage disk you’re using up already. And also extra options like adding custom domain names.\n\n\n9:16\nBut for now, what we need is under this API configuration tab. Here you’ll find the project URL and two API keys.\n\n\n9:26\nOne is a public key, so this is for the Supabase client. This one is okay to be revealed, because this is the one that’s\n\n\n9:33\nusually embedded with the front end client anyways. It’s going to be what your website uses to call the Supabase backend.\n\n\n9:41\nThe other one is a secret key. This is useful for doing backend server-side operations. This one you definitely do not want to reveal.\n\n\n9:49\nSo now we’re going to copy the URL and the public key back to our project. And then back in your project, go to your .env.local\n\n\n9:57\nfile, or create one if you didn’t do it already. And we’ll only need these two things, we actually don’t\n\n\n10:02\nneed these other keys, so we can delete those. And go ahead and paste your project URL and your public key.\n\n\n10:10\nNow to work with Supabase from our local environment, we’re going to want to use the Supabase CLI.\n\n\n10:16\nSo just search for Supabase CLI on Google, and you should see the official documentation pop up.\n\n\n10:22\nThen scroll down and follow the instructions for your specific platform to install the CLI.\n\n\n10:29\nThen you can verify the installation using this command. For this video I’m using Supabase version 2, so if you’re\n\n\n10:35\nusing a different major version, then keep in mind that some of the CLI commands may be different.\n\n\n10:41\nNow back in our development environment, you’d normally have to run this command to initialize Supabase\n\n\n10:46\nto add it to a project that doesn’t have it yet. But for our project, I actually initialized Supabase\n\n\n10:51\nearlier, and you can tell because there’s a Supabase folder with a config file. So we don’t have to run the command again for this one.\n\n\n10:59\nWe will need to run this command to link your local project with the remote Supabase project.\n\n\n11:05\nDon’t forget to replace the PROJECT REF variable with your own one. Your project reference is basically the random ID part of your URL.\n\n\n11:14\nWhen you run this command, it’s going to ask you to enter\n\n\n11:19\nyour database password from when you created the project. So go ahead and do that as well.\n\n\n11:27\nNow that should work successfully, but it might throw a warning about the local config being different from the linked project.\n\n\n11:34\nBut I wouldn’t worry about that for now. Then to test if everything is set up correctly, you can run this command.\n\n\n11:40\nYou should see a list of projects, and you should also see a dot next to the one that is linked.\n\n\n11:47\nAlright, so at this point we’ve downloaded the project code, and we’ve set up the Supabase project itself. Let’s move on to the next step.\n\n\n11:54\nNext, we’re going to set up Google Cloud so that we can let our users log in with a Google account. Supabase actually has a lot of different options\n\n\n12:01\nfor signing in, but I prefer to just use a third party integration like Google, because it’s\n\n\n12:07\nboth easier for us to maintain, and it’s also easier for our customers as well, because they\n\n\n12:12\ndon’t have to sign up for a separate account. First, head over to the Google Cloud console, and then either\n\n\n12:18\nlog in or create an account if you don’t already have one. And if this is your first time using Google Cloud,\n\n\n12:25\nyou will also have to create a new project. So I’ve created a project here for this SaaS application.\n\n\n12:32\nNow you might also need to attach a credit card to this account, but the OAuth pricing\n\n\n12:37\nis free for up to 50,000 monthly active users, so you probably won’t get charged.\n\n\n12:43\nSo once you’re on this page, go to the search bar at the top and type in “Credentials”, and\n\n\n12:48\nselect “Credentials” from “API and Services”. Now on this page, click here to create credentials, and select “OAuth client ID”.\n\n\n12:58\nFor the application type, choose “web application”, and then type in a name for it here.\n\n\n13:05\nNow we also have to add the authorized JavaScript origins and the authorized redirect URIs.\n\n\n13:13\nFor the authorized origin, put your Supabase project URL, and you can also put localhost so that\n\n\n13:18\nwe can test it from our development environment. And for the redirect, put in this URL.\n\n\n13:24\nThis is actually provided to us by Supabase. If you go to authentication, then to providers,\n\n\n13:30\nand then expand the Google tab, you will see the callback URL here for us to copy.\n\n\n13:36\nSo let’s go back to the project and put that in. So now your settings should look something like this,\n\n\n13:42\nand then you can go ahead and click “create”. And when that’s done, you should see this little pop-up\n\n\n13:48\nwith your client ID and your client secret. So go back to your Supabase dashboard, go to authentication,\n\n\n13:56\nand then providers, and then open the Google tab, and enable “sign in for Google”.\n\n\n14:03\nAnd then just paste the client ID and the secret from the previous step, and click “save”.\n\n\n14:09\nWhile we’re here, you can also check out all the other authentication providers available, in case you want to use them.\n\n\n14:16\nAnd just an interesting note, I’ve also enabled email as a provider, and I think that’s the default for a new Supabase project anyways.\n\n\n14:23\nBut for testing purposes, I actually disabled this “confirm email” feature, because it\n\n\n14:28\nmakes it easier for me to create test users. Okay, so now you’re done with auth, and your Supabase project\n\n\n14:34\nshould be wired up to let users log in with Google. Next, we’re also going to need an OpenAI API key.\n\n\n14:41\nWe’re going to be using this for our back-end feature, where we automatically assign\n\n\n14:46\nlabels to a task, based on its description. Now, this API is pay-per-use, but the pricing is quite\n\n\n14:53\ncheap, and our usage is going to be very low. If you don’t have an OpenAI account, then go to platform.OpenAI.com to create it.\n\n\n15:02\nLog into your account, and then open the search bar, and search for “API keys”.\n\n\n15:08\nAnd then you can click up here to create a new API key for your project. So go ahead and create that, and then copy the secret key.\n\n\n15:15\nThen, back in your project terminal, run the Supabase-cli command to set the OpenAI key as a back-end secret.\n\n\n15:23\nThe project will be using this later on in our server-side edge functions. The final dependency we need for this project is Stripe, and we’re\n\n\n15:33\ngoing to use this to process payments for our customers. So, back in our app, we limit users to only creating 100 tasks per month.\n\n\n15:43\nAnd when they upgrade to Premium, the limit gets raised to 10,000. Now, this is probably not the best business model\n\n\n15:50\nfor this app, but the point is just to show you how to implement this at a technical level. Compared to our other dependencies, Stripe is a little bit more complex to set up.\n\n\n16:00\nBut I’m going to try to keep this as simple as possible. There are three main steps we need to go through.\n\n\n16:06\nFirst, we want to create an account and set up the Stripe CLI. And then we’ll have to create a product, which\n\n\n16:11\nis basically the subscription for our app. And finally, we’ll need to set up webhooks so that\n\n\n16:17\nStripe can tell our Supabase server whenever there’s an update with our customers’ payments.\n\n\n16:23\nIf you don’t have a Stripe account yet, then go to stripe.com and create one. Once you’re signed in, you should be on this dashboard.\n\n\n16:31\nJust go to the top and make sure that you enable test mode. This will basically let us test the whole integration\n\n\n16:38\nwithout using real money or credit cards. Our Stripe account will also have a secret API key.\n\n\n16:45\nSo to find it, just go into the search box and type in “API key” and then go to “developers\n\n\n16:50\nAPI key.” And take note of the secret key here, because we’re going to need this for later.\n\n\n16:56\nNext, we’ll need to install the Stripe CLI. So just search for Stripe CLI on Google and it\n\n\n17:01\nshould link you to the official documentation. And if you scroll down, you’ll see different tabs depending\n\n\n17:07\non which platform you want to see the command for. Once you’ve installed it, then run this command in\n\n\n17:12\nyour terminal to log in with your Stripe account. Next, let’s use the Stripe CLI to create a new product and a price.\n\n\n17:20\nIn Stripe, products and prices are two distinct object types. And a product can have multiple different prices, but\n\n\n17:28\nevery price must be associated with a product. Now, to create the products and the prices, we can go to our Stripe\n\n\n17:35\ndashboard and then click to create them through there. But we can also do it with a command in the CLI, which is a little bit faster.\n\n\n17:45\nSo that’s what I’m going to do for this project. So if you go back to the project and then you open the README file, scroll all the way down until\n\n\n17:51\nyou see the part that says Stripe setup. And there’s a couple of commands that you can just copy and paste into your terminal\n\n\n17:59\nto create the product via the CLI directly. This command will create both a price and a product for us together.\n\n\n18:06\nIt creates a $10 monthly subscription for a new product called Taskmaster Premium with a 14-day trial.\n\n\n18:14\nSo go ahead and run that in your project terminal. And when it’s done, you should see an output object like this.\n\n\n18:22\nAnd we’re going to want to take note of the price ID because we will need that for later. Next, we’ll also need to run another command to set up the customer portal.\n\n\n18:32\nThis is going to set up a page that customers can go to to either update or cancel their subscriptions.\n\n\n18:39\nJust make sure that before you run this command to replace the URLs with your own Supabase URLs.\n\n\n18:45\nAnd in this project, I actually haven’t created the privacy or the terms of service pages. So these links will probably just bounce back to the homepage.\n\n\n18:54\nSo that’s something you can add if you want. And to finish our Stripe setup, we will need to add a webhook.\n\n\n19:03\nA webhook is a URL endpoint that we provide that Stripe can send events and notifications to.\n\n\n19:09\nAnd it will use this to tell us about things like successful checkouts and subscription cancellations.\n\n\n19:15\nAnd then we’ll use that information to update our database. So go back to your Stripe dashboard and then search for webhooks.\n\n\n19:23\nAnd then go to Developers / Webhooks. And here, click add endpoint.\n\n\n19:29\nOur webhook endpoint is going to look something like this. We will implement this later as an edge function.\n\n\n19:35\nJust make sure to update the project ID to your actual Supabase project URL.\n\n\n19:41\nAnd then enter it here as your endpoint.\n\n\n19:47\nNext, you have to select which events for it to listen to.\n\n\n19:53\nThese are the four events that you need to select. These events will give us everything we need to build the\n\n\n20:04\nsubscription functionality that we want for our app.\n\n\n20:12\nOnce you’ve filled in the endpoint and the events, then click add endpoint. And now your webhook will be set up and you can\n\n\n20:20\nclick here to get your webhook secret key. So now we should have all the keys we need to integrate Stripe with our project.\n\n\n20:28\nIf you missed one of them, then just rewind this chapter. And again, here’s the Supabase CLI command you need to\n\n\n20:34\nrun to set up the secrets in the Supabase project. So go ahead and run these for each of the keys.\n\n\n20:41\nWe’re going to need the Stripe API secret key, the price ID and the webhook secret.\n\n\n20:47\nSo back in my terminal, I’ve set up all three keys. And to confirm that I can run Supabase secrets list.\n\n\n20:56\nAnd that will show me all the different secrets that I’ve registered with my Supabase project. So at this point, you should see four of them.\n\n\n21:04\nNow there’s actually one more place where we need to set up our Stripe secret key. And that’s going to be in our vault table in the database.\n\n\n21:12\nAnd this is an inbuilt Supabase table where we can store secret keys that our database can use as part of automatic triggers.\n\n\n21:20\nIn this project specifically, I’m using it so that I can make Stripe create a user for\n\n\n21:26\nus whenever we create a user in Supabase. Because there are different user systems, but we want them to be associated.\n\n\n21:33\nWe’re going to implement that using a database trigger. But to do that, it will need to have the stripe secret\n\n\n21:38\nkey so that it has the authority to create new users. To add this, go back to your Supabase dashboard and then go to SQL editor.\n\n\n21:46\nAnd that in this window, we’re going to run this command.\n\n\n21:52\nJust remember to replace this with your actual secret key from Stripe. And then click run and then you should see that it should\n\n\n22:00\ncreate this key for you and return a key ID. And if you’ve accidentally added the wrong\n\n\n22:06\nsecret or you just want to update it, then you’ll need to use this command instead. So now that we’re done setting up our dependencies, let’s go\n\n\n22:14\nback to our Supabase project and set up our database next. Our database is going to be a Postgres SQL database\n\n\n22:21\nand we’re going to create three tables. We’ll have a profile table for each user.\n\n\n22:28\nThere we will store information about their account status. Now this is going to be read only for the user.\n\n\n22:35\nIt’s also going to be linked to an auth table, which comes out of the box with Supabase. This means that our user ID primary key in\n\n\n22:43\nthis profile table is going to map directly to a user ID in the auth table as well.\n\n\n22:50\nAnd you’re going to see this pattern where we use a primary key for the user as a foreign key in each of our tables.\n\n\n22:58\nNow our most important table is going to be this task table here. We will store each task as a row and it will have a user ID as part of its key.\n\n\n23:09\nAnd finally, we’ll also have a separate table to track the usage of each user per month.\n\n\n23:15\nAnd the reason I decided to use a separate table to track the usage is that I think it will\n\n\n23:21\nbe easier to scale that way, rather than tracking it in the user profile table directly.\n\n\n23:27\nSo this is going to be the schema for the database. But on top of this, we will also have security policies and triggers.\n\n\n23:35\nWe’re going to use something called row level security. That basically means that to be able to read or update a\n\n\n23:42\nrow of a database, certain conditions have to be met. For example, we can check if the user ID of a request matches\n\n\n23:50\nthe user ID value of the row that we want to access. And then we use row level security to enforce these roles for our app.\n\n\n24:00\nAnd we’re also going to have something called triggers. Triggers are functions that we can execute when\n\n\n24:05\nsomething happens inside our database. And these functions are run by our dedicated PostgreSQL server.\n\n\n24:12\nIn this project, we will use them quite a lot. We’ll use triggers to update task limits for each user whenever they create a task.\n\n\n24:20\nWe can also stop them from creating new tasks once they’ve reached their limit. We’ll also use it to automatically create a Stripe\n\n\n24:28\nuser whenever a new user is created in our system. That’s because, as I mentioned before, Stripe has its own user system.\n\n\n24:36\nSo we need some automation to link them together. And finally, we can also use it to automatically clean up our\n\n\n24:42\nusers and our storage when things are deleted as well. Now, that’s a lot of stuff I just went through.\n\n\n24:48\nSo how are we going to implement all of that very quickly? Well, with Supabase, we can write instructions\n\n\n24:54\nfor all of those things using SQL files. And if we go back to our project and then we\n\n\n24:59\ngo to the Supabase migrations folder, you’ll see that we have a bunch of SQL files for each of these things that we want to add.\n\n\n25:06\nAnd if you click through them, you could see the statements used to create the tables. So here’s the table schema.\n\n\n25:13\nAnd you can also see triggers being created and security policies being created. And the reason I’ve separated each of these statements\n\n\n25:21\ninto separate files is just to make it easier for you to understand each new thing that we’re setting up.\n\n\n25:28\nIt’s exactly the same as if I had all of these statements in one giant file, but that’s just going\n\n\n25:33\nto be a little bit more difficult to read. To apply these files to a project, you can run this command.\n\n\n25:40\nThis is called apply a migration. It will execute all of the SQL statements in each file in lexical order.\n\n\n25:48\nAnd so if you go back to our project, you’ll see that each of our SQL files has a number in front of it. And so basically that’s the order that I want to run the files in.\n\n\n25:56\nBut in a real world situation, I think that people would typically use a timestamp for this number.\n\n\n26:02\nSo I’m going to go ahead and run this now in my terminal. And once the command is done, Supabase will have\n\n\n26:08\ncreated all the databases, triggers, and security policies that we told it to in those SQL files.\n\n\n26:16\nNow notice if I try to run the command again, it doesn’t actually\n\n\n26:21\ndo anything, even if I change the contents of these files. That’s because these commands, once they apply a migration file,\n\n\n26:30\nit kind of remembers that it’s already done that file. So if you want to create new migrations, you actually\n\n\n26:37\nhave to create a new file and just make that number in front of it keep increasing.\n\n\n26:43\nBut if the project is still in development like this one here, and you wanted to do a full reset, you can run this command instead.\n\n\n26:50\nThis will clear your entire database and then run every SQL file from the beginning. And once you finish running your migration, you can\n\n\n26:56\ngo to your Supabase project to check it out. So go to database and then go to schema visualizer, and you should\n\n\n27:02\nsee the schema for the database that you just created. And something very cool that I want to mention about Supabase\n\n\n27:09\nis that it automatically creates an API for your database. So you can do CRUD operations from your front end really\n\n\n27:16\neasily without having to implement the API yourself. You can read more about that feature inside the REST API\n\n\n27:23\nor the Data API documentation on the Supabase website. Now back to the app, one of my favorite features here\n\n\n27:30\nis that users can upload images to their tasks. To implement this, we’re going to use Supabase’s storage feature.\n\n\n27:37\nAnd I have some good news for you. If you ran the previous command, then you’ve already set this up.\n\n\n27:43\nOne of our SQL files from the previous step actually creates something called a storage bucket. It did that by creating an entry in this built-in storage buckets table.\n\n\n27:53\nAnd behind the scenes, that actually causes Supabase to set up a storage bucket for us.\n\n\n27:59\nSo if you go back to your Supabase dashboard and then you go down and click storage, you’ll see that it’s created a bucket for us here.\n\n\n28:06\nAnd the bucket doesn’t have anything in it right now. But if you go here and click edit bucket and click on\n\n\n28:12\nadditional configuration, you’ll see that we’ve actually configured the bucket already from our SQL schema.\n\n\n28:18\nWe’ve configured it to restrict the upload size to one megabyte, and we’ve also configured it to only accept images.\n\n\n28:25\nNow I do want to mention that I did make this bucket public, which means that if people have the URL to an\n\n\n28:31\nimage, they can actually just go ahead and see it. And I did that because it’s more simple to set it up with the front end.\n\n\n28:39\nBut if you were doing this for real, then I probably recommend making this private. It’s just that it’s a little bit more complex to set up.\n\n\n28:46\nSo it’s a little bit out of scope for this video. So now we’ve set up the database and the storage,\n\n\n28:51\nand we’re moving on to the final setup step, which is deploying our edge functions.\n\n\n28:57\nEdge functions are custom functions that run on demand in response to HTTP requests.\n\n\n29:03\nThink of them as a way to run any code that you’d normally need a server for. In our project, you’ll find them in the Supabase/functions folder.\n\n\n29:11\nEach subfolder is an edge function. The code is implemented as a TypeScript function,\n\n\n29:16\nand it will be run in a Deno environment. So here, I’m just going to go back to the project to show you where they are.\n\n\n29:23\nGo to your Supabase folder, and then go to your functions folder. And then each of the functions is going to be its own separate subfolder.\n\n\n29:30\nIf you open that up, you’ll see this index.ts file, and that is the code for one of our functions.\n\n\n29:37\nNow, we will be able to build and deploy these functions directly from our project using the Supabase CLI.\n\n\n29:45\nThey also support environment variables, which is where we can go and fetch those secrets that we\n\n\n29:51\nstored earlier when we set up our dependencies. Here’s a short snippet from one of our functions,\n\n\n29:57\nand it’s the function called createTaskWithAI. This function will create the task and then put it into the table.\n\n\n30:04\nAnd after that, it will use AI to determine automatic tag or a label for the task based on the task title,\n\n\n30:11\nand then it will update the task with that tag. The second function is called createStripeSession,\n\n\n30:18\nand we’ll be using this in the profile page. So this is here, and when users click this to\n\n\n30:24\nmanage their subscription, this function will generate a URL for them, and this URL will\n\n\n30:30\neither be a checkout session or customer portal depending on the user’s account status.\n\n\n30:36\nFinally, the third and the last function is our webhook endpoint for Stripe. So if you recall from the Stripe chapter, this\n\n\n30:43\nis an endpoint that Stripe will use to send us event notifications when something happens.\n\n\n30:49\nWe will use this to detect when the user should be upgraded to premium or when the subscription ends and\n\n\n30:54\nthey should be downgraded back to the free tier. And as I mentioned before, these functions will all have\n\n\n31:00\naccess to the Supabase secrets that we stored earlier. So that’s how they can access services like Stripe and OpenAI on our behalf.\n\n\n31:09\nFrom our project root, you can use these commands to deploy each of the functions to our Supabase project.\n\n\n31:16\nOnce that’s finished, you can go back to your Supabase dashboard\n\n\n31:23\nand then check them out by clicking edge functions.\n\n\n31:29\nAnd if everything worked correctly, you should see three separate edge functions being created for us.\n\n\n31:35\nIf you click on one of them, you’ll also be able to see links to metrics and logs. So this is where you can go to debug them.\n\n\n31:43\nNow there’s one more thing we need to do. Click on your Stripe webhook function and then\n\n\n31:48\ngo to details and then scroll all the way down to function configuration and then click to disable\n\n\n31:55\nenforce JWT verification and click save. This verification is there to check that whoever calls\n\n\n32:01\nthis function is one of our authenticated users. And that’s what we want in most cases.\n\n\n32:08\nBut in this particular case, we’re expecting Stripe to call this function. And with that, we finally finished all of our setup\n\n\n32:16\nprocess and we’re ready to run the project. Go back to your project terminal and run this command\n\n\n32:21\nto start the local development server. Once you’ve run it, you should see this local URL pop\n\n\n32:29\nup and you can click that to open your project. And if it doesn’t load right away, you might need\n\n\n32:35\nto refresh it, but you can probably now test that each of the features work as intended.\n\n\n32:41\nSo we can log in with Google. We can create a new task.\n\n\n32:52\nAnd when we create a task, we should see that it automatically assigns a label for us that is appropriate for the task.\n\n\n32:59\nWe should also be able to edit a task and add images to it. And then if you go to your profile page, you should\n\n\n33:08\nsee that your task created is tracked properly here and that if you click manage subscription,\n\n\n33:16\nyou get taken to a Stripe checkout page. And then finally go back to our project and just make sure that you can sign out.\n\n\n33:24\nNow if you wanted to deploy something like this, then the easiest way to do this is probably with Vercel,\n\n\n33:30\nbut this is basically just a static NextJS website. So you can use any other process that works for static websites in general.\n\n\n33:37\nIf you wanted to add new functionality or extend the project to do something specific, then here’s\n\n\n33:43\na rough overview of the project structure. The UI elements are in the apps and the components folder.\n\n\n33:49\nThe front-end logic is in the hooks folder, so that’s the client that will connect to Supabase.\n\n\n33:55\nAnd the backend logic is in the Supabase functions folder. And the database and configurations are in the migrations folder.\n\n\n34:03\nAs I was working on this project, I also actually created an integration test suite so that I can quickly\n\n\n34:09\nand more easily test the project’s functionality. You’ll find all the test code in the project under\n\n\n34:15\nthe test/integration directory, and these tests will actually connect to your real project.\n\n\n34:21\nIf you want to run them, then create a file like this to store all of your environment variables\n\n\n34:26\nthat are going to be used in the task, and then update them with your version of these API keys.\n\n\n34:32\nThen go to your terminal and run this command in your project root to run the entire test suite.\n\n\n34:38\nYou can also use this command if you want to run just a specific file.\n\n\n34:45\nNow all the tests should pass, but they might fail the first time due to timeouts because I think\n\n\n34:50\nthat some of these code paths have a cold start. So if you just run them for the first time, they might take a little bit slower than usual.\n\n\n34:57\nSo if they fail, then I recommend to try running it again and seeing if it works. So we’re now at the end of the video.\n\n\n35:04\nThat was quite a large project, and I hope you managed to get everything to work. But if you got stuck or if you have any questions,\n\n\n35:10\nthen feel free to leave a comment either here or on my GitHub page for the project.\n\n\n35:16\nNow as I said at the start, this was a very high-level overview of using Supabase.\n\n\n35:22\nWe went through a lot of stuff very quickly, and there’s a lot of details that I simplified along the way.\n\n\n35:28\nNow if you are interested in diving a little bit deeper, then go to the project repository and check\n\n\n35:34\nout this tutorials folder where I’ve actually created a bunch of different documents for each major\n\n\n35:40\nfunctionality that we introduced to the project. If you did enjoy this and would like to see a tutorial\n\n\n35:45\nseries covering each of these features in more detail, or you want to see an end-to-end tutorial for a different type of project entirely,\n\n\n35:52\nthen please let me know in the comments. Otherwise, I hope this was useful, and I’ll see you in the next one.",

This makes it much easier to review your setup and debug it when there are problems. In addition to the keys, urls, etc, it can be helpful to paste screenshots into this Word document to help you remember where you retrieved the info from and where you copied it to.\nKeep in mind that much of this configuration information should be treated as “secret info” similar to your passwords.

When someone uses a package to write their software, they should record the version number of of the package that was used. This is important because sometimes later versions of the package might not work with the software that was written to use an older version of the package.\nPackage updates (and hence version numbers) fall into one of the following categories:\n\nMAJOR updates: new features that are not necessarily totally compatible with existing software that used older versions of this package.\nMINOR updates: new features that are intended to be backward-compatible with older versions\nPATCH fixes: ie. bug fixes that are intended to be backward-compatible with older versions\n\nThe npm package version numbers reflect the type of changes that were made to the package since the last version. THe version numbers in the form: MAJOR_NUMBER.MINOR_NUMBER.PATCH_NUMBER\nFor example the version number 0.7.1 has\n\nMAJOR_NUMBER 0\nMINOR_NUMBER 7\n\nPATCH_NUMBER 1\n\nWhen a new version of a package is released, the major, minor and patch numbers in the version number are updated accordingly.",

    "text": "17.5 using a “^” before a version number (e.g. “^1.1.2”)\nIt is common for version numbers to be listed with “special characters” that direct npm to install possibly later versions of the package than the specified version.\nFor example, a caret, i.e. ^, before a version number, e.g. ^1.1.2 , directs npm to install “this version or a later version that has the same MAJOR number”. This is often desired since versions of a package that have the same MAJOR version number should be compatible with each other.\nFor example the following line:\n    \"@radix-ui/react-checkbox\": \"^1.1.2\",`\nindicates that this project requires version 1.1.2 or later of the package. However, this will only install the latest 1.X.X version. It will NOT install any version from 2.0.0 or later.\nThe logic for this is that the original developer of our project probably developed the code for the project using version 1.1.2 of the package. If in the future a new improved version 1.1.3 would be released to fix some bugs in the package then that version should be used instead of 1.1.2. The same would be true if even later versions of the package would be release such as 1.1.4 or 1.1.5 or even 1.2.0 - the latest of any 1.X.X version would be used.\nHowever, if a new MAJOR version is released, e.g. 2.0.0 then that would NOT be used when doing npm install for this project. The reason is that a new MAJOR version is not guaranteed to work with code that was written for a prior MAJOR version number of the package.",

In practice, though, that’s not always true. To minimize potential issues, it’s best to install the project using the exact same package versions as those used by the original developer. Doing so ensures you’re working in the same environment and helps you avoid unexpected differences in behavior.\nFor this reason, when npm installs a package into the project, it records the EXACT version number that was installed into a file named package-lock.json. If the package-lock.json file exists then npm will install whatever version is registered in the package-lock.json file. However, if there is no package-lock.json file in a project then the rules stated above regarding which package is installed are followed. To be clear:\nnpm install will do the following:\n\nIf a package-lock.json file exists then the versions recorded in that file are downloaded to the node_modules folder.\nIf there is no package-lock.json file in the project then the versions of the packages as indicated in the package.json file are downloaded to the node_modules folder. Note that these could be later versions than the actual numbers listed in the file. For example if the package.json file lists version ^1.7.3 then the latest version number that still has a 1 in the first position will be installed.

In npm, a deprecation warning can refer either to an entire package or, more commonly, to a specific version of a package. In most cases, it means that the maintainers recommend upgrading to a newer version because the version being installed is outdated, has known issues, or has been superseded. This could happen if the package-lock.json file that was in the git repo has versions of packages that had later releases of new versions after the package-lock.json was created.\nThis generally should not be a problem for a learning tutorial. However, if you are planning on using this code in “production” it is recommended that you delete the package-lock.json file and re-run npm install. This should install the later versions of those packages that may have fixed some bugs. Hoewver, be aware the the original developer did not use these new package versions and therefore the code you have might not work 100% as expected and you might need to spend a little time debugging and testing the application.",

In general this means it allows for newer versions that have the same major number. For example:\n\n^1.2.3 → &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0\n\nHowever, if the major version is 0 (e.g. 0.2.3) the caret works a little differently. A major version 0 is intended to signal that the package is still experimental or under active development. Because the package is not considered stable, even small changes—like a minor or patch update—may break existing code.\nFor this reason, npm’s version range rules become more restrictive for major-zero versions: the ^ will only allow updates that keep the left-most non-zero digit the same.

Slower than others.\nYarn – fast installs; good caching. Old v1 now legacy.\nYarn Berry – no node_modules; great for managing many packages together. Complex setup.\npnpm – space-efficient; strict resolution. Some tools misbehave.\nBun – ultra-fast; includes runtime.

    "text": "18.1 More about the .env files\nPrivate information such as passwords and API Keys (which we will discuss later) should never be stored in git because git repositories are often shared with other people. For similar reasons, passwords, API keys, etc. should also never by typed directly into Javascript code or code of any other programming language.\nA typical web project requires different passwords, API keys, etc to allow integration with external services. In this project we will be integrating your NextJS app with Supabase, Google OAuth and the Chatgpt API. Each one of these integrations requires some sort of “secret” info (password, API Key, etc) to authenticate (i.e. login) to the remote system.\nMuch of this “secret” information will be stored in files whose filenames include “.env”. Remember that the .gitignore file identifies the files in your project that should never be committed to git. The .env files are prevented from being committed to git by referencing them in the .gitignore file.\nIn this project, we will need two different .env files. You will need to modify the contents of these .env files with the API keys that you generate for your Supabase account and other accounts.\nThe developer of this tutorial created one .env.example file. This is just an example file. It doesn’t contain real info. It should be copied into the locations for the .env files that we will be using.\nFor now, we will just copy the .env.exapmle file in the two locations. We will come back later and modify these files and explain more about them.\nYou need to create two local .env files for environment variables. These files will contain API keys and configuration that you’ll add throughout this tutorial. Note that the File names must be exact:",

Supabase has many different features (database, authentication, edge functions, storage buckets, etc). You can configure most of what you need to configure by “clicking around” on the website.

If you install the command another way, you would just type supabase and not npx supabase. Keep this in mind if you ask any of the popular AI LLMs for help. They might tell you to type supabase ... and you need to know to actually type npx supabase ...",

In this section we are discussing installing the supabase CLI on your local computer - not the supabase server. \n\nIn this tutorial we will be using npx to run the supabase CLI. However there are some benefits to acutally “installing” the supabase command on your computer. If you use npx to run the supabase CLI, then every time you run the npx supabase command, the latest copy of the supabase npm package is downloaded to your computer. If you don’t have access to the Internet, things become more complicated. For this and other reasons, some people prefer to install the supabase CLI on their computer. You can do so by using one of the options listed below. Note that if you do install supabase on your computer then the command would simply be\n\nsupbase ...(other options)...\n\ninstead of\n\nnpx supabase ...(other options)....\n\nSee official instructions for how to install here: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started The following summarizes your options to install locally:\n\nInstall the supabase CLI command as an npm package. To do so, run the following command from the root (top level folder) for your project:\nnpm install supabase --save-dev\nNOTE: installing using the -g option to npm is no longer supported\nYou can also install the supabase CLI command on Mac by using the Homebrew package manager or on Windows by using the Scoop package manager. See the instructions here https://github.com/supabase/cli?tab=readme-ov-file to learn more about this option.\nYou can also download the actual program files from here: https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases. Be aware that this page lists “pre-release” versions as well as “release” versions. The “pre-release” versions may have the latest fixes and modifications but are not supported. For example, at the time of this writing the latest “release” version is 2.58.5 but there are “pre-release” versions 2.58.6, 2.59.*, 2.60.1, 2.60.2 Use the pre-release versions if you want the absolute latest features but be aware that they may not have been fully tested.",

    "text": "21.7 Find your project’s reference ID\nIn the next step we will “link” the project on your computer to your Supabase project that you setup on the Supabase website. To do so, you will need to know your “project ref”. It is listed in the output of the npx supabase projects list command (see above). For example, the REFERENCE ID for the 2nd project listed above is bvysrsysihcpsomfkyja.\nThe project reference ID is also part of your project’s URL. You can find your project URL in your Supabase dashboard URL. It looks something like this: https://app.supabase.com/project/bvysrsysihcpsomfkyja The part after /project/ is your project ref, ie. in the example above this would be bvysrsysihcpsomfkyja. However, your own project-ref will obviously be different.\n\n21.7.1 Link your project\nOnce you have identified your project ref, open your terminal, and navigate to your project directory. Then run the following command where “YOUR_PROJECT_REF” is replaced with your actual project ref. This command creates a connection between your local machine and your cloud project so that future commands from the CLI will knows which project you’re working with.\nnpx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF\nFor example, given the example above the command would be: The ouput shown below is what I got when I ran the command. This indicates that my project is linked with the remote supabase server. The WARNING that you see is harmless. Click on the link below to understand more about this warning message.\n\nnpx supabase link --project-ref bvysrsysihcpsomfkyja\nInitialising login role...\nConnecting to remote database...\nFinished supabase link.\nWARNING: Local database version differs from the linked project.\nUpdate your supabase/config.toml to fix it:\n[db]\nmajor_version = 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick for an explanation of the WARNING message\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers often run a local version of the Supabase server that allows them to develop their project without having Internet access. When the developer wants to synchronize the work that they did on their local computer with the remote Supabase server, they can link their project to the remote project (as we did here) and then run the command npx supabase push to “push” their work to the remote server. For this to work correctly, the supabase version that is installed locally must be compatible with the supabase version on the remote server.\nWe decided that for simplicity, we will not use a local installation of the Supabase server. However, when this git repo was originally developed, the developer did have a local Supabase server installed on his computer. The file config.toml that is in the supabase folder stores configuration information for the local Supabase server. When this project was originally developed, the supabase/config.toml file got committed to git.\nThe warning message is simply saying that the recorded version of the local Supabase server not compatible with the version for remote Supabase server. However, as we said above, we are not using an actual local Supabase server. Therefore we can ignore this message. Alteratively, we can change the contents of the supabase/config.toml file by modifying the lines in the supabase/config.toml that record the local supabase version to read as follows:\n[db]\nmajor_version = 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.7.2 Test the link\nYou can run the following commands to test that your link has been established correctly.\nThe following should show all Supabase projects your CLI account has access to:\nnpx supabase projects list\nThe following should show whether your local directory is currently linked to a Supabase project:\nnpx supabase link status",

    "text": "23.3 Create API keys\n\n23.3.1 Click API Keys\n\n\n\n23.3.2 Click Create new secret key.\n\n\n\n23.3.3 Key Owner - “YOU” or a “SERVICE ACCOUNT”\nWhen creating the key you need to specify whether the key is owned by “you” or by a “service account”. See more explanation below.\n \nAPI Keys that are owned directly by “you” are useful when you are performing experiments with AI or just getting to understand how things work. In addition some 3rd part websites ask you to upload an OpenAI API key so that the work that they do for you is billed to YOUR OpenAI API key - i.e. the service doesn’t pay for the AI processing it does on your behalf, you do. It makes sense for these types of keys to be owned by “You”.\nHowever, when creating software products that use API Keys it’s recommended to create a “Service Account” for that product and have the key be owned by that service account. The use of the key can then be tracked to your product’s “service account”.\n\nSetting permissions for keys owned by “You”\nIf you create a key that is owned by “You” (see above) then you are given the opportunity to set permissions that govern what is and what isn’t allowed to be done with the key. This is especially important if you are going to be using your API Key to access 3rd party services. You can restrict the API Key to only allow some features to ensure that the 3rd party service doesn’t abuse the use of the key (as use of the API key would be charged to you).\nIf you create a key that is owned by a “Service Account” (as recommended for this project) then you can set permissions\n\n\nSetting permissions for keys owned by a “Service Account”\nBy contrast, the permissions for a key that is owned by a “Service Account” are governed by the service account’s “role”. To change what the key can do, you must change the service account’s roles/permissions, not the key. We’ll see below (after saving the key) how to modify the permissions for such a key.\n\n\n\n23.3.4 Copy the key immediately — you won’t be able to see it again.\nWhen you click “create secret key” (see above) you will be shown the actual key. Copy the key immediately and save it — you won’t be able to see it again.\nThe key should be treated in the same way as a password. (In the following screenshot the API Key is purposely obscured). It is secret information which should never be divulged to anyone outside of your organization. Even within your organization, only people who have a “need to know” should be given access to the actual key value. Therefore do NOT commit this to git because git repos are often shared with people who should not have access to this type of info.\n\nIn the next section we will explain how to store this API Key in the supabase/.env file. This is because the communication with OpenAI will be done via a Supabase Edge Function. Much of the other “secret” information that we will be using in this tutorial will also be stored in .env files (see the section above that describes more about .env files).\nFor now, I recommend that for the purposes of this tutorial, you also store all of the secret info in a Word document (or similar). This is NOT the recommended approach for actual software development projects. However, as you are learning it can be helpful to have one file that stores all of the “secret information” in one place. You can store notes and screenshots in this file that help you remember where you got the information (e.g. OpenAI) and what it will be used for.",
